## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

## Proposed Solution
<h3>Our proposed solution is a <strong>Smart Crop Advisory Platform</strong> designed specifically for small and marginal farmers. 
It is a multilingual mobile and web application that provides <strong>personalized, real-time recommendations</strong> 
for crop selection, fertilizer usage, irrigation scheduling, and pest management.
</h3>
<ul><li>Detailed explanation of the proposed solution
The platform integrates <strong>AI-powered advisory</strong> with real-time <strong>weather data, soil health reports, and satellite inputs</strong> 
to guide farmers in making data-driven decisions. Farmers can <strong>upload images of diseased crops</strong>, and the system’s 
machine-learning models will instantly identify the pest or disease and suggest effective remedies.
</li>
<li>How it addresses the problem
To ensure accessibility for farmers with low literacy, the platform offers <strong>voice-enabled assistance</strong> and a simple, 
icon-based interface in local languages. It also includes <strong>market price tracking and alerts</strong>, helping farmers 
decide the best time and place to sell their produce.</li>
<li>Innovation and uniqueness of the solution
The uniqueness of this solution lies in <strong>combining localized crop advisory, AI-driven pest detection, 
real-time weather and market data</strong>, and <strong>offline usability</strong> into a single lightweight application. 
This integrated approach empowers farmers with accurate information, reduces dependency on unreliable sources, 
and promotes sustainable farming practices.

## Technical Approach
<h3>The Smart Crop Advisory Platform uses a combination of AI, mobile technology, and cloud-based services to deliver personalized advice to farmers.</h3>
<ul><li>Technologies to be used (e.g. programming languages, frameworks, hardware)
Technologies to be used:
- Frontend: Flutter for cross-platform mobile app (Android & iOS)
- Backend: Python (Django/FastAPI) and Node.js for APIs
- AI/ML Models: TensorFlow / PyTorch for pest and disease image detection
- Database: PostgreSQL for storing soil, crop, and farmer data; Firebase for real-time alerts
- Cloud Services: AWS / GCP for hosting, scalability, and integrating weather & market data APIs
- APIs & Integrations: Government datasets for soil health and market prices, IMD APIs for weather updates</li>
<li>Methodology and process for implementation <b>(Flow Charts/Images/ working prototype)</b>
. Farmer registers in the app and provides basic farm details (location, soil type, crop history).
2. The system fetches weather, soil, and market data from integrated APIs.
3. The AI engine analyzes these inputs and recommends suitable crops, fertilizer schedules, and irrigation plans.
4. Farmers can upload images of pest-affected crops; the model diagnoses the issue and suggests treatment.
5. Real-time alerts on weather changes and market prices are sent through in-app notifications, SMS, or voice messages.
6. Data collected from farmers helps improve the advisory engine over time.

This approach ensures real-time, location-specific advisory services that are accessible even in areas with limited internet connectivity.</li></ul>

## Feasibility and Viability
<h3></h3>
<ul><li>Analysis of the feasibility of the idea
Feasibility of the Idea:
- The increasing availability of affordable smartphones and mobile internet in rural areas makes the solution practical and widely deployable.
- Government APIs for weather, soil health, and market prices are already available and can be easily integrated.
- Open-source datasets such as PlantVillage make it feasible to train AI models for pest and disease detection.
- The app’s lightweight design with offline capabilities ensures usability even in areas with poor connectivity.
</li>
<li>Potential challenges and risks
Potential Challenges and Risks:
- Limited digital literacy among small and marginal farmers.
- Poor or unstable internet connectivity in remote villages.
- Initial mistrust from farmers towards new digital advisory tools.
- Risk of inaccurate predictions due to insufficient or outdated data.
</li>
<li>Strategies for overcoming these challenges
Strategies to Overcome Challenges:*
- Provide a multilingual voice-enabled interface with simple icon-based navigation to help farmers with low literacy.
- Enable offline mode and integrate SMS/IVR-based advisory for areas with poor connectivity.
- Build trust by partnering with local agricultural officers, cooperatives, and NGOs for community-level demonstrations.
- Continuously improve the advisory engine by updating it with the latest agricultural data and farmer feedback.</li></ul>

## Impact and Benefits
<h3></h3>
<ul><li>Potential impact on the target audience
Potential Impact on the Target Audience:
- Empowers small and marginal farmers to make informed, data-driven decisions for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use.
- Reduces farmers’ dependency on middlemen and unreliable sources of agricultural advice.
- Increases confidence and self-reliance among farmers through timely, localized guidance.
- Bridges the gap between scientific agricultural knowledge and farmers at the grassroots level.</li>
<li>Benefits of the solution (social, economic, environmental, etc.)
Benefits of the Solution:
- Social Benefits: Improves rural livelihoods by increasing productivity and enhancing food security.
- Economic Benefits: Helps farmers reduce input costs and increase crop yields, improving their income.
- Environmental Benefits: Promotes sustainable agriculture by reducing excessive chemical fertilizer and pesticide usage.
- Government and Policy Benefits: Provides real-time data for better policy-making and targeted subsidies.
